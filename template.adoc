= Load CSV Demo GraphGist

ifdef::env-env-graphgist[:FILTER: WHERE row.job = 'ACTED_IN']

This GraphGist demonstrates how to load a sample dataset from a CSV contained in the same GitHub Gist.

== Setup

The CSV file contains movies and actors, our usual example data.

You can find it https://gist.github.com/jexp/f78df7b232d0faa171ff#file-movies_actors-csv[here] in the GitHub Gist https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jexp/f78df7b232d0faa171ff/raw/movies_actors.csv[raw file].

Now let's load the data with Neo4j's LOAD CSV command.

//setup
[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jexp/f78df7b232d0faa171ff/raw/movies_actors.csv" AS row
WITH row {FILTER}
MERGE (m:Movie {title:row.title}) ON CREATE SET m.released = toInt(row.released), m.tagline = row.tagline
MERGE (p:Person {name:row.name}) ON CREATE SET p.born = toInt(row.born)
CREATE (p)-[:ACTED_IN {roles:split(row.roles,";")}]->(m);
----

//graph

== Top Five Actors

Now we can query the data, eg. give us the five top actors with their filmography:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
RETURN a.name, count(*) as freq, collect(m.title) as movies
ORDER BY freq DESC
LIMIT 5
----

//table

== The Movies of _Tom Hanks_.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Person {name:"Tom Hanks"})-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
RETURN *
----

//graph_result
